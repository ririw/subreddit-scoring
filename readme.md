Subreddit scorer code
=====================

To run:

`PYTHONPATH=. luigi --local-scheduler --module subreddit_linkage.sim_score AllSimScores`

You'll need to download some reddit comment data, if you're the kind of person who's 
interesed in these things, you're the kind of person who can find such data, but I 
don't want to link directly, because I don't want to overload some poor person's server.
